\section{Widely Linear Filtering and Adaptive Spectral Estimation}

\subsection{Complex LMS and Widely Linear Modelling}

\subsubsection{The CLMS and ACLMS}
We are introduced to the Complex LMS, which is a modification of the LMS filter, but designed to operate with complex signals. The $ \mathbf{w}$ weight term is replaced with $ \mathbf{h}$, and the estimation is now $ \hat{y}(n) = \mathbf{h}^H(n) \mathbf{x}(n) $, with the weight update being performed as $ \mathbf{h}(n+1) = \mathbf{h}(n) + \mu e^{\ast}(n)\mathbf{x}(n) $.

We are also introduced to the Augmented CLMS, which is designed to identify the second order (if there is any) statistical relationship of the input and output. It is effectively an extension of the CLMS, and adds the weights $ \mathbf{g}$, in addition to $ \mathbf{h}$ as defined for the CLMS. The esimtation equation becomes  $ \hat{y}(n) = \mathbf{h}^H(n) \mathbf{x}(n) + \mathbf{g}^H(n) \mathbf{x}^\ast(n) $. The next estimated of $ \mathbf{g}$ is defined as $ \mathbf{g}(n+1) = \mathbf{g}(n) + \mu e^{\ast}(n)\mathbf{x}\ast(n) $.

We generated a WLMA(1) (Widely Linear Moving Average) process which is defined as $ y(n) = x(n) + b_1 x(n-1) + b_2 x^{\ast}(n-2) $, where $ x \sim \mathcal{N} (0,1) $. The coefficients are defined as $ b_1 = 1.5 + 1j $ and $ b_2 = 2.5 - 0.5j$. We run this process through both the CLMS and ACLMS filters. 100 indepdent sets of noise were generated and run through both filters (identical signals, to ensure a fair comparison), with the mean of at each iteration taken. Figure \ref{fig:4_1_a_clms_err} shows the learning error. We can see that even in steady state, there appears to be significant modelling error, sitting at 8dB. This is also apparent in figure \ref{fig:4_1_a_clms_weights} where we can see the estimated weights of $\mathbf{h}$. We are unable to see the values of coefficients related to $ b_2 $.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:4_1_a_aclms} shows the same plots but this time from the ACLMS filter. We can immediately see that the learning curve in figure \ref{fig:4_1_a_aclms_err} is significantly better than those seen in figure \ref{fig:4_1_a_clms_err} with the CLMS filter. Since we are modelling an WLMA process, the output can be determined directly from the input (unlike with a `next step' estimator), so we expect the error to be very small. This is also evident in the weights in figure \ref{fig:4_1_a_aclms_weights}. We also observe that we can see 4 weights (the real and imaginary components of both $ \mathbf{g}$ and $ \mathbf{h}$), as opposed to the two seen in the CLMS. We can observe that the values associated with $ b_2 $ are represented by $ \mathbf{g} $.

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{\textit{Learning Curve and Estimated Weights from the ACLMS fitler}}
	\label{fig:4_1_a_aclms}
\end{figure}

We can conclude that the CLMS was unable to represent the WLMA properly - the coefficients of $b_2$ which were from the conjugate of $\mathbf{x}$ were nowhere to be seen in the CLMS, but very clear in the ACLMS. The fact that the learning curve of the CLMS showed a large steady state error is evidence that the model was a poor fit for the CLMS.

\subsubsection{Bivariate Wind Data}

We are given wind data for a slow, medium and high wind regime. The data contains wind East-West wind speeds, as well as North-South wind speeds for a given point in time. We represent these in complex form, as $ v[n] = v_{east}[n] + jv_{north}[n] $. Figure \ref{fig:4_1_b_circ} shows the circularity plots for all three regimes of wind. All of the circularity plots appear to be fairly circular. The low wind seems to have a narrower Real set of data than it does in the Imaginary plane. The high wind appears to be shofted off centre, but also has significantly higher amplitude than the low wind (as we would expect!). It appears to have some correlation, observed on the positive real and negative imaginary axes.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering 
	\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{\input{fig/4/4_1_b_circularity.tikz}}
	\caption{\textit{Circularity Plots for Wind Data}}
	\label{fig:4_1_b_circ}
\end{figure}

With the 5000 data points for each wind regime, we can test out filters to predict the next state of the wind. Figure \ref{fig:4_1_b_order} shows the different regimes tested against both the CLMS and ACLMS filters, with varying model orders. As defined in Section \ref{sec:3_3_a}, we use the Mean Squared Prediction Error to find the optimal filter and order. Although there will be some error during setup as the filter coefficients initialise, this is common to all filters and thus will be considered part of the error. The Low Wind demonstrates good performance, with an MSPE of -19dB at a minimum, with it tending to -22dB as the order increases. The ACLMS appears to outperform the CLMS, although only marginally. Medium Wind has a minimum (ie optimum filter length) at 4, using the ACLMS. It obtains an MSPE of around -12.3dB. Interestingly, the CLMS outperforms the ACLMS at values higher than this. The high wind is interesting, as for high model orders the MSPE is very large (hundreds of dB). With an ACLMS model order of 1, an MSPE of -6.25dB is acheived, which represents reasonable performance, especially when considering what happens with a larger order filter!

In conclusion, we are able to model all three systems effectively (all with an MSPE of -6dB or better) in a next value predictor set up, using widely linear filtering. We find that in all three cases the ACLMS does outperform the CLMS, at least for the optimum values (the minimum of these plots) which we are interested in.

\subsubsection{Three Phase Power: Balanced \& Unbalanced Systems} \label{sec:4_1_c}

Using the Clarke Voltage, we can compute $v(n)$ for both a balanced and unbalanced system. Figure \ref{fig:4_1_c} shows the circularity diagram of the complex voltage (both a balanced and unbalanced system). The balanced system has a circular shape to it, whereas the unbalanced system's circularity diagram is more akin to a rugby ball than a circle. The unbalanced nature of the system was demonstated when either a phase shift is introduced in to one or two of the lines, or the voltage across each phase is different. In this case, a phase shift of $\frac{\pi}{8}$ has been applied to one phase, with another having phase shift $-\frac{\pi}{7}$.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\resizebox{0.45\textwidth}{!}{\input{fig/4/4_1_c.tikz}}
	\caption{\textit{Balanced and Unbalanced Complex Voltages}}
	\label{fig:4_1_c}
\end{figure}

Assuming a fault on the system will either cause a disturbance in voltage levels, or shift the phase, its circularity plot would start no longer looking like a circle, but instead take a distorted shape like that observed in Figure \ref{fig:lab_3_1 } for the unbalanced system.


\subsubsection{Three Phase Power: Widely Linear AR models} \label{sec:4_1_d}
We are given the strictly linear and widely linear AR(1) models used on three phase power systems, and from this we are able to determine the frequency of the Clarke Voltage.

For the strictly linear case, we know the model is defined as $ v(n+1) = h^\ast (n) v(n) $. Using the definition of the Clarke voltage for a balanced system [\cite{Mandic2015}], we know that
\begin{equation}
v(n) = \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} V e^{j(2 \pi \frac{f_o}{f_s}n + \phi)}
\end{equation}

We can equate these two equations together in order to determine the operating frequency from the weights of the CLMS model:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	v(n+1) &= h^\ast (n) v(n) \\
	e^{j(2 \pi \frac{f_o}{f_s}(n+1) + \phi)} & = h^\ast (n) e^{j(2 \pi \frac{f_o}{f_s}n + \phi)} \\
	e^{j(2 \pi \frac{f_o}{f_s})} & = h^\ast (n) \\
	2 \pi \frac{f_o}{f_s} &= \arctan \left( \frac{ - \Im \{ h(n) \} }{ \Re \{ h(n) \} } \right)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Note: the equations in the coursework handout appear not to have taken in to account the negative conjugate, which is why if applied in \texttt{MATLAB} exactly as here, they will result in producing a negative frequency.


The unbalanced system is a slightly more involved derivation. Firstly we use the definitions of the Clarke Voltage and Widely Linear models (respectively) for an unbalaced system:

\begin{equation}
v(n) = A(n) e^{j(2 \pi \frac{f_o}{f_s}n + \phi)} + B(n) e^{-j(2 \pi \frac{f_o}{f_s}n + \phi)}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
v(n+1) = h^\ast(n)v(n) + g^\ast(n)v^\ast(n)
\end{equation}

We can then substitute these together

\begin{multline}
 A(n+1) e^{j(2 \pi \frac{f_o}{f_s}(n+1) + \phi)} + B(n+1) e^{-j(2 \pi \frac{f_o}{f_s}(n+1) + \phi)} = h^\ast(n) A(n) e^{j(2 \pi \frac{f_o}{f_s}n + \phi)} + B(n) e^{-j(2 \pi \frac{f_o}{f_s}n + \phi)} + \\g^\ast(n) A^\ast(n) e^{-j(2 \pi \frac{f_o}{f_s}n + \phi)} + B^\ast(n) e^{j(2 \pi \frac{f_o}{f_s}n + \phi)}
 \end{multline}



\subsubsection{Estimating the Frquency}

Based on the Strictly and Widely linear filters, we can estimate the frequency. Based on the data produced in section \ref{sec:4_1_c}, we can reverse engineer the system frequency.

For the case of the balanced system, the strictly linear equation returns $ -50Hz$ as the system frequency. As mentioned in \ref{sec:4_1_d}, this is likely due to a conjugate error during derivation. The system also identifies the unbalanced system as $ 50.051Hz $. This was measured using the widely linear input. If we use the strictly linear equations, we are returned the frequency $ -50Hz$ (or $50Hz$). This will be because the stringly linear system does not have the weights and parameters (namely $ \mathbf{g}(n) $) to model the unbalanced system correctly.
