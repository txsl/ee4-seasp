\subsection{Periodogram-based Methods Applied to Real-World Data}

\subsubsection{The Sunspot Time Series}

Presented with the Sunspot Time Series data, there are a number of preprocessing techniques we can apply to it before plotting the Periodogram. These are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:1_4_a}. We observe that for the original data there is a high power at 0 frequency. This is the influence of the mean signal, so for other signals we mean centre the data. We can see that the detrended version (the black line) appears to suffer from less noise or jitter in the frequency domain. Taking the logarithm of data and mean centering it (the pink like) showed very interesting results. The line at points appears to jitter even less, for example at 0.35, the other lines suffer from a signficant drop, but it moves little by comparison.

\subsubsection{Brain Computer Interface (BCI)}

We can see in figure \ref{fig:1_4_b_org} the periodogram taken for the entire signal. There is clearly a lot of noise, and thus analysing the periodogram itself to find the peak. Instead, we take the mean of windowed periodograms. Figures \ref{fig:1_4_b_1s}, \ref{fig:1_4_b_5s} and \ref{fig:1_4_b_10s} show the mean periodograms for windows of 1, 5 and 10s respectively. They have also been run through Hanning and Bartlett windows, as an experiment to see if they imrpove the periodogram. The 1s periodogram is argubly too smooth and as such difficult to interpret any spike between 11$Hz$ and 20$Hz$ (although the lobe at 10$Hz$ is noticable). The 10s periodogram may be a little too noisey, but the 5s mean does seem to represent a good balance between noise and still having obvious peaks. As such, we can estimate that there is a peak at approximately 13 $Hz$ which represents the SSVEP.

In order to get a better quality periodogram, it may well be worth investigating the Welch method next time.
