\subsection{Spectrum of Autoregressive Processes}

\subsubsection{Shortcomings of the Unbiased ACF}
As discussed in \cite{Mandic2014}, the unbiased ACF may not always be invertible. In order to use modern spectrum estimation techniques such as this section, the autocorrelation matrix must be invterible. If it is not, we are unable to continue using the Yule Walker equations to compute weights for the estimated model.

\subsubsection{Modelling an AR Process}

Given the equation $ x(n) = 2.76x(n-1) -3.81x(n-2) + 2.65x(n-3) - 0.92x(n-4) + w(n) $ where $ w \sim \mathcal{N} (0, 1)  $. We are also adviced to discard the first 500 samples as the filter initiailises itself. Given a range of potential model orders to estimate the signal from, we find that an AR(5) process is liekly the best fit, as determined by visual inspection. There appears to be little value increasing the model order significantly - as the peaks come more defined, but overall they add little more.

\subsubsection{Increasing data length when modelling}

Figure \ref{fig:2_2_c} shows the same plot as before, but this time with 10,000 samples rather than 1,000 as before. We can see clear under modelling with an attempted AR(2) process - it shows only one peak rather than the two in the data. Once again, there appears to be little value from over modelling since the extra weights appear to do very little to improve the estimate of the system. As before, the best fit does to be from the AR(5) estimate.
